## First queries ##

This is a rudimentary collection of **queries** on the databases *nesshub* and *public*
comprising the invoices in the time interval between the 1st and 7th of January. 

### queries & python-sql ###

These queries allow one to have a first taste for these databases. 
For example, in the folder `queries` and `python-sql` there are queries to determine:
*  in which hour of the daythe highest numberof invoices is issued, 
* the best client, i.e., the client sending and receiving the highest number of invoices 
* and so on. 

### public ###

The database `public` comprises repeated invoinces. Our pupose was to get rid of the *wrong* ones, 
producing a .csv containing only the *good* ones.
